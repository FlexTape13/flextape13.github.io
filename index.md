## Overview

Wearable skin temperature sensors are increasingly used to monitor thermoregulation during exercise and heat exposure. However, wireless devices must be validated against established reference probes before widespread use.

This study evaluated the agreement between a wireless skin temperature sensor (eTemp Performance) and a thermistor-based reference probe (Physitemp SST-1) during rest, exercise, and recovery in a controlled hot environment.

Across 794 paired measurements, the eTemp sensor showed **strong agreement** with the reference probe, with a small mean bias of **0.27°C** and limits of agreement within accepted validation thresholds. Results support the eTemp sensor as a practical wireless alternative for skin temperature monitoring in exercise and environmental physiology.
