## Overview

Wearable skin temperature sensors are increasingly used to monitor thermoregulation during exercise and heat exposure ([1,2](#references)). However, wireless devices must be validated against established reference probes before widespread use.

This study evaluated the agreement between a wireless skin temperature sensor (eTemp Performance) and a thermistor-based reference probe (Physitemp SST-1) during rest, exercise, and recovery in a controlled hot environment.

Across 794 paired measurements, the eTemp sensor showed **strong agreement** with the reference probe, with a small mean bias of **0.27°C** and limits of agreement within accepted validation thresholds ([3,4](#references)). Results support the eTemp sensor as a practical wireless alternative for skin temperature monitoring in exercise and environmental physiology.
