# MRSA

**Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA)** is a type of bacterium that is resistant to several commonly used antibiotics. It is primarily transmitted through direct contact with contaminated skin or surfaces and is commonly associated with healthcare facilities and other environments involving frequent human contact.

This project focuses on the environmental and contact-based aspects of MRSA rather than pharmaceutical treatment.

## Survival on Surfaces

MRSA is capable of surviving on a variety of inanimate surfaces for extended periods of time. Survival duration depends on environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and surface material.

Commonly affected surfaces include:
- Door handles and railings
- Shared equipment
- Bedding and furniture
- Clothing and personal items
- Electronic devices

Contaminated surfaces can act as reservoirs, allowing repeated transfer of bacteria through indirect contact.

## Skin Colonization

Human skin is the primary site of MRSA colonization. Individuals may carry MRSA on the skin or in the nasal passages without showing symptoms of infection.

Transmission occurs through:
- Direct skin-to-skin contact
- Contact with open cuts or abrasions
- Use of shared personal items

Asymptomatic carriers contribute to the spread of MRSA by transferring bacteria without visible signs of infection.

---

## Environmental Transmission

MRSA transmission is often maintained through a combination of surface contamination and repeated contact. Environments with high population density or shared facilities increase the likelihood of spread.

Control efforts commonly focus on:
- Surface cleaning and disinfection
- Limiting shared contact points
- Use of physical barriers such as gloves or clothing
- Reducing opportunities for skin exposure

## Emphasis on Non-Pharmaceutical Control

While antibiotic resistance is a defining characteristic of MRSA, environmental management plays a critical role in limiting transmission. Preventive measures aimed at reducing surface contamination and contact frequency are often more effective at reducing spread than treatment after infection has occurred.
