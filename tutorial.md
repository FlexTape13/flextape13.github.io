## What Is MRSA?
MRSA is a fast-paced game where positioning, timing, and knowing the mechanics matter way more than button-mashing. New players usually die because they rush in without understanding how things work — this guide helps prevent that.

---

## Basic Controls
Before doing anything fancy, make sure you understand:
- How to move
- How to interact with objects
- How to attack / defend (if applicable)
- Any sprint, crouch, or special ability keys

💡 Tip: If you don’t have these down, stop and practice before jumping into real gameplay.

## Your First Minutes (IMPORTANT)
The first few minutes decide whether you survive or throw.

**Do this:**
- Stay aware of your surroundings
- Don’t rush enemies immediately
- Learn where safe spots and resources are
- Watch how other players move

**Do NOT do this:**
- Sprint everywhere
- Chase kills
- Ignore sounds or visual cues

## Common Noob Mistakes
Avoid these and you’re already better than half the lobby:
- Standing still too long
- Tunnel-visioning one target
- Not managing resources
- Panicking instead of repositioning

The video above shows these mistakes clearly — watch how they’re avoided.

---

## Beginner Tips
- Play slow at first
- Learn the map before trying risky plays
- If something feels unsafe, it probably is
- Dying is normal — learn *why* it happened

---

## Final Advice
MRSA rewards patience and awareness. Don’t worry about being cracked on day one — focus on surviving longer each run.
